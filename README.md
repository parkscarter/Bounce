Bounce: this is my rendition of Atari's first game, PONG!

This is a two player game, but one player can still enjoy;
P1 use 'e' and 'd' to move your paddle, P2 use the up and down arrows

I chose to focus my efforts on game mechanics rather than graphics;
however, I'm excited to implement some nicer looking features in the future.

Enjoy!
