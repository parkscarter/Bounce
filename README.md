Bounce: this is my rendition of Atari's first game, PONG!

This is a two player game, but one player can still enjoy;
P1 use 'e' and 'd' to move your paddle, P2 use the up and down arrows

To play: 
First download a zip file of this repository, then unzip the file and 
store it somewhere on your computer (like Desktop or Downloads)
Then use your command line or terminal to cd to the folder;
type the command 'make' to build the file,
then type './bounce' to start the game

I chose to focus my efforts on game mechanics rather than graphics;
however, I'm excited to implement some nicer looking features in the future.

Enjoy!
